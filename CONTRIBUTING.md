Please abide by the following:

- List the component alphabetically.
- Reference it only once.
- Describe it succinctly, sufficiently, and without flair. (No line wrap in your listing.)
- If available, please also include a direct link to a demo site.
- If available, please also include a direct link to a separate docs site.
- Don't mention "React" in the description.

Here's an example of how your listing should appear:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - [demo](https://reactjs.org/) - [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- _PLEASE ALSO REMOVE ONE (or more) UN-AWESOME COMPONENT IN ANY PR._ We want this list to remain fresh. So when you do ANY PR, please also remove at least 1 un-awesome component. This could be a component that hasn't been updated in a year or more, for example.
